Equivalised Income:
To compare economic prosperity of households of differing
sizes, income is divided by an equivalence factor to obtain the
equivalised income. For a single-adult household the equivalence
factor equals 1, for a married couple without children 1.5. 0.3
is further added to the factor per child/supported household
member. (www.estv2.admin.ch/d/dokumentation/zahlen_fakten/karten/2014/equivalent.htm)

Gini Coefficient:
The Gini-coefficient of incomes is a widely used indicator for
income inequality. The higher it is, the more unequal the
distribution of income. The coefficient ranges between 0 (all
incomes are the same) to approximately 1 (all incomes except
one are 0). (www.estv2.admin.ch/d/dokumentation/zahlen_fakten/karten/2014/gini.htm)
